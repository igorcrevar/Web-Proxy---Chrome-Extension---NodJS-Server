Web Proxy chrome extension + nodejs server

Get desired page(photo, any other file) from desired banned domain via own web proxy server

start node server somewhere
add chrome extension

Set pages which will be redirected automaticly to web proxy
Open all other urls in web proxy mode if you wish

todo:
relative urls inside "proxied" pages, cookies


for now this is only good for single pages(pictures :)) of banned sites
